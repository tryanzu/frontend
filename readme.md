# Meet Anzu

Anzu is our greatest endeavor to build the most rad, simple & reactive forum software out there since the Javascript revolution. 

Forum platforms to host communities are vast. Many would say it's a lifeless space with almost zero innovation, and attempting to create something new is pointless. We dissent, and if you found this repository you might also share with us the idea that there has to be an alternative to the old forum. Well, we think Anzu is that young and sexy software that could bring back to life the community-building movement.

This repository contains the front-end repository.
We're still working in the first alpha, so previous knowledge about the stack is required to set things up.

## Installation

### Download dependencies
The first step is to download Go, official binary distributions are available at [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
If you are upgrading from an older version of Go you must first [remove the existing version](https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.11.4.darwin-amd64.pkg#uninstall).

[Download the package file](https://golang.org/dl/), open it, and follow the prompts to install the Go tools. The package installs the Go distribution to /usr/local/go.
The package should put the /usr/local/go/bin directory in your PATH environment variable. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

Make sure you have defined your GOPATH:

```zsh
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

Now you need to download and configure **MongoDB** and **Redis**. Alternatively you can use remote servers.

Install `dep` for go dependencies: [https://github.com/golang/dep](https://github.com/golang/dep). In MacOS it can be installed with `brew`.

Execute the following command: `go get https://github.com/cespare/reflex`

Reflex probably only works on Linux and Mac OS.

### Download the repositories

Download the [core](http://github.com/tryanzu/core) in any path.

Initialize the repo submodule, so the [frontend](http://github.com/tryanzu/frontend) is in `static/frontend`.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install the core dependencies with `go build`.

Install the frontend dependencies with `yarn install`.


### Configure

Copy the `.env.example` file into `.env` and edit it to meet your local environment configuration.

Edit `static/frontend/src/index.html`. The `window.Anzu` variable is the configuration section.

### Last steps

Execute the script `develop.sh` to have hot reload (compile and run) while editing the core code.

Execute `brunch watch -s` in `static/frontend` to have hot reload while editing the frontend code.
